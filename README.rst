    * Minimalistic code (15 lines only)
    * OOPs Class-object
    * Create cutom Library
    * Docker - for cross platform
    * Ability to pass command-line arguments

    * Handling various errors differently
    * Logging mechanism
    * Report generation
    * More comments
    * Using other languages -Java, C#
    *Various conventions & standards
